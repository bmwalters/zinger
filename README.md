Zinger!
======

Zinger! is a team based fretta gamemode that combines action, adventure and strategy wrapped around a game of mini golf. Shoot, trap, drug and destroy your opponents with a ridiculous arsenal of weapons at your disposal. Battle along side your teammates and claim your victory on each hole. With the course as your battleground and the cup as your goal, you'll need to avoid obstacles, teleport distances and jump across a melody of puzzles. Zinger! bundles all this excitement and more with a rich visual style and cartoon atmosphere; blending a 2D backdrop into a 3D world.
