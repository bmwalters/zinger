HELP.text = [[The main goal each round is to beat the opposing team to the cup by activating rings to raise your flag. Once your flag has reached the top, the cup is unlocked and your team is ready to sink their ball.

Round scores are calculated by quickest to the cup, least strokes to the cup and bonuses gained throughout the round. The team with the highest score wins the round.]]
