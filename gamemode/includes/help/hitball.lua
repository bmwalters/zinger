HELP.text = [[To hit, left click your ball and the aim assist will appear. Move your mouse in the opposite direction you want your ball to go. The aim assist will display which direction you're aiming and even show how your ball may bounce off a wall.

The further away you move your mouse from the ball, the stronger your hit will be. Hit strength is displayed on the hit indicator. Chose each shot wisely and try to keep them to a minimum.]]
