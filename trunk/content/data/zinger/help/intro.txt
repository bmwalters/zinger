Basics:Introduction:1
Zinger! is a team sport primarily based around a game of miniature golf. As you complete each course, you'll collect supplies and bonuses to aid you and your team. Remember, this is not a turn-based game. Each player takes their turn independently from their teamates. Cooperation and stradegy is a must, so be sure to communicate with your team and stop your opponents at all costs!
